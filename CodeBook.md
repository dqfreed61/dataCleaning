# Introduction

The script run_analysis.r performs these  steps for the course project

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data frame
    (X_test.tst, y_test.text and subject_test.txt for test and X_train.txt, y_train.txt, subject_train.txt are the inputs) The       data frame with the merged data is trainTest

2. Reads features.txt and creates a vector of column names. The column name vector is named col.name and these names are applied    to trainTest data frame columns
 


2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variableÂ names.
5. Creates a new tidy data set
